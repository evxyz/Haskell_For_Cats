Haskell_For_Cats 
CatchingUp with Us:

We are currently on Chapters 4 and 5

Book is in More/File sec of the MeetUp site.

Please download and install the G.H.C. (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) which is part of: http://www.haskell.org/platform/

For OSX-Maverick heres some special instructions, http://haskell-workshop.github.io/tutorials/osx/2013-10-23-mavericks-ghc.html

here is the link to the Eriks video: https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/Lecture-Series-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-1 
we have done videos 1-3 already along with the corresponding chapters in the Book mentioned above. 
the goal for Sunday Jan 5th is Chapter 4 & exersizes and getting through Chapter 5. 




NOTE! the Haskell-platform, has all the tools we'll need and then some. The book and video both use the deprecated Hugs compiler; it works okay; but the renowned Glasgow Haskell Compiler 7.6.x included in the Haskell-platform, is the current standard.

When it's installed and you open a command prompt (terminal) and type ghci you should get the prelude prompt, Prelude>. And you are ready to go.


Any text editor will do, but some do a better job of highlighting and such. Popular choices are Emacs, Vim, Sublime and Notepad++. It's a good idea to set tabs to spaces otherwise GHC might complain.
